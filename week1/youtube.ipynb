Uh chance of job placement. So we do not provide you job placement. So we are not recruiters. We just teach this uh and we are not a boot camp where you pay money. Right? So this is a free boot camp and our resources are limited. So we cannot really uh do this for you. That said, many of many course participants who took this course in the past successfully found the job. So this is this is going to be the fifth time we are hosting this. So yeah, many many people have graduated from this course and many people found the jobs. So yes, there is a high chance to find a job placement after the program because the teach we the skills we teach here the skills we cover here they are the most important skills for a machine learning engineer.

So this is the area where many data scientists um don't know or not they know but like maybe this is their weak areas. So this is we we're going a little deeper in this side. That's why it's more like an engineering program, ML engineering program. And with these\"}]"

There is an emphasis on engineering skills related to machine learning, including containerization and deployment of models, making it more suitable for those aspiring to become machine learning engineers. The course is a blend of theoretical knowledge and practical deployment skills necessary for real-world applications. \\n\\nFor more details, see the discussion at timestamp 3:03 - 4:14 and 34:21 - 35:38 in the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph1PxZIkz1o.'"
